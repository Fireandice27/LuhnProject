# LuhnProject
Objective: Implement the Luhn Algorithm to check for valid credit card numbers.

What is the Luhn Algorithm?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

The Luhn Algorithm can be used to check the validity of many different kinds of digit strings; this app only aims to validate 15- and 16-digit credit card numbers.

With "LuhnProject," I have used an implementation of the core algorithm (found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/luhn-algorithm/) and attempted to improve on it in several ways:
* Add an input prompt for user-generated credit card values, rather than a single hard-coded one
* Add much more robust and informative output text
* Implement an error-checking function to ensure that the user provided value is a numerical string of the correct length for a credit card
* Add unit testing to try to eliminate bugs in the app

LuhnProject was developed as a code demo for Daemen College. Rather than submit a prior academic exercise, I decided instead to begin a new project with "someone else's" code (since that's what I'd encounter if hired at the college) and work to expand, enhance, and secure it with code of my own (which would be my primary work in a developer role at the college). My hope is that this creates a more prudent and realistic picture of my skills as they relate to the role for which I'm being considered.
