# LuhnProject
Improving concept of Luhn function

Overview: The Luhn function is used to check the validity of many numbers, but this program will focus on its use as checking the validity of a credit card number. 
The purpose of this project is to find ways to improve the intial concept of the Luhn function. This will be accomplished by prompting a user for number input, 
checking for the correct number of digits, and validating that only positive integers are entered.
